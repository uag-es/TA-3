#Thiago Bastos
Feature: Add Group Criterion
  As the teacher
  I want to be able to register new criteria
  So I can evaluate the students with these criteria

--Output from Register a group of criteria that does not exist--
--Output from Register a non-existent group of criteria--
  #Controller Scenario
  Scenario: Register a group of criteria that does not exist    # AddGroupOfCriteria.feature:8
    Given the criterion "C1" is not on the system               # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:35
    And the criterion with name "C2" is also not on the system  # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:42
    When I create the group of criteria "C1;C2"                 # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:49
    Then the criterion "C1" is added to the system              # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:56
    And the criterion "C2" is also properly added to the system # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:61

--Output from Register a group of criteria that some of them already exists--
  #GUI Scenario
  Scenario: Register a non-existent group of criteria                   # AddGroupOfCriteria.feature:16
    Given I can not see the criterion "C3"                              # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:76
    And I can not see the criterion "C4"                                # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:76
    And I am at the Add Group of Criteria page                          # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:84
    When I fill the field Nome with the name "C3;C4"                    # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:89
    And I finalize the criteria registration                            # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:94
    Then I should see the "C3" criterion available on the criteria list # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:100
    And I should see the "C4" criterion available on the criteria list  # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:100

--Output from Register a group of criteria that some elements of it already exists--
  #Controller Scenario
  Scenario: Register a group of criteria that some of them already exists # AddGroupOfCriteria.feature:26
    Given the criterion with name "C5" isnt on the system                 # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:119
    And the criterion with name "C9" is on the system                     # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:125
    When I register the group of criteria "C5;C9"                         # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:133
    Then the criterion "C5" is in the system                              # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:139
    And the criterion "C9" is not added to the system                     # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:143

  #GUI Scenario
  Scenario: Register a group of criteria that some elements of it already exists     # AddGroupOfCriteria.feature:34
    Given I can not see the criterion "C6"                                           # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:76
    And I can see the criterion "C7"                                                 # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:159
    And I am at the Add Group of Criteria page                                       # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:84
    When I fill the field Nome with the name "C6;C7"                                 # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:89
    And I finalize the criteria registration                                         # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:94
    Then I should see the "C6" criterion available on the criteria list              # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:100
    And I should see the "C7" criterion only one time available on the criteria list # AddGroupOfCriteriaSteps.groovy:173
