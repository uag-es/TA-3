  ##GUI
  #  Scenario: Be notified about the students's performance issues
  #    Given I am at the home page
  #    When I go to the Reports page
  #    Then the item "Reports" on the menu will show if there are new notifications

  ##GUI
  #  Scenario: Notify new report type
  #    Given that the report with name "70% of evaluations are MPA", evaluation "MPA", type "Porcentagem", value "0.7" is in the system
  #    And I am in the Evaluation page
  #    When I add the evaluation "MPA" to the student "Joan", login "jsd"
  #    Then 70% of his evaluations are composed of "MPA"
  #    And I should see a new notification related to the new report type
